The TixPop System is a web-based application created to provide a more user-friendly and efficient way of booking tickets for concerts and live events. In the past, most people had to purchase tickets through physical counters or through third parties, which often led to long queues, delays, and the risk of tickets being sold out quickly. This project focuses on overcoming these issues by introducing an interactive online system that allows users to make ticket purchases from anywhere and at any time.

    The system includes a secure login page to ensure only authorized people can access the page. Once logged in, users are provided with interactive forms containing text fields, dropdown menus, and checkboxes to input their details and preferences. To make the system more interactive , buttons such as submit, search, and view are added, while proper page navigation and hyperlinks help users move smoothly between sections of the website.
    By using these features, the TixPop System not only improves user convenience but also supports organizers in managing ticket distribution more effectively. The purpose is to create a flexible, user-friendly, and reliable platform that enhances ticket booking experience for both users and administrators.
